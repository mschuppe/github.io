[abstract]

My interest in voice draws me into the area between music and language. 
An area which I see as the coast between words and music, where the grain of language and the fluidity of sound converge.
The suspense caused by the
concurrency of sound and meaning is guiding my commitment since the eightees, where I began to delve
into the music of xref:index.adoc#scelsi[Giacinto Scelsi] and xref:index.adoc#feldman[Morton Feldman]. I have pursued this interest, moving between
german and english, in various ways: xref:index.adoc#selbdritt[improvisation], interpretation, inventing my own xref:index.adoc#nosongs[songs], developing
projects xref:index.adoc#summe[for voices] and with voice-ensembles, xref:index.adoc#teaching[teaching], mentoring, writing.
In recent years I have more specifically explored the borderlands where music transforms into xref:index.adoc#buch[poetry].
In this vein xref:index.adoc#colline[colline sur livre] is my most recent and ongoing work.
