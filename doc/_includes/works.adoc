I started to write music for myself,  because most of the existing contemporary voice pieces where not offering what I was interested in. I was interested in something beyond academic contemporary music, in between existing styles. I wanted to us my trained voice in a different way. Thus I began my own experiments. Starting from the body, singing sounds for a long time, listening to impulses of voice and body as they came up. This practise is still the base for my work .

=== composer-performer

writing for oneself isn’t different from writing for others, you just know a little bit better, what you might be able to risk and you will not make the performer to do things she doesn’t identify with

=== composing for voices

Since the middle-eightees I have enjoyed passing on my experiences to others. I have taught singers, dancers, speakers, instrumentalists, teachers and other enthusiasts to develop their voices through groupwork and individual lessons. I have given masterclasses and lectures on voice in improvisation in Europe and Asia and worked in theatre- and dance-productions as a voice trainer and musical advisor. From this practise ideas for ensemble pieces arose and were realized.
My compositions, often notated as text-scores, are providing a precise frame with possible different outcomes and are engaging performers with decisions of their own. They have been performed by trained voices as well as by less- or non-trained voices.
