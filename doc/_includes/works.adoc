Listening to a voice, one may hear sounds or words. Words are linked to a specific language and understanding. Sounds may hide the voice as a human source. Though sounds are not bound to a specific vocabulary, they are as well carrying meaning, intended or not.
Words and sounds constitute the presence of voice and do not exist independently. Both have a specific physicality. They interact, within or outside language. Together they enfold the complexity of singing.

My compositions are rooted in my practise as a singer, vocalist, writer and teacher.
Steps throughout these interweaving acitivities were :
song - movement - improvisation - sound - breath - word - song - extended. Find a selection of my pieces here:

=== composing for voices

Since the middle-eightees I have enjoyed passing on my experiences in elementary and experimental voice-work and singing to others.
I have trained singers, dancers, speakers, teachers and other enthusiasts to develop their voices through groupwork and individual lessons.
I have worked in theatre- and dance-productions as a voice teacher and musical advisor and
I have given masterclasses and lectures on my work in Europe and Asia.
I work with my own intergrative voice-body-technique based on classical singing, breathing-work
(after Erika Kemmann, Institut für Atemlehre Berlin and Atem-Tonus-Ton developed by Maria Höller)
and movement (Roni Segal). This training facilitates improvisation, interpretation of an individual repertoire or other forms of creation.
It is based on my own singing and performance practise of more than three decades and enriched through my experiences with Central-Asian vocal music.
From 1995-2010 I have educated singers and speakers in the Atem-Tonus-Ton-method in Switzerland, Germany and Japan.
Since 2013 I have been working as a guest-lecturer for voice and improvisation at the FHNW University of Music in Basel and other swiss university-music departments.
Since 2008 I have been the director of an advanced student ensemble, which focuses on improvisation,
ways of singing together mostly without tuning forks and has staged several performance-projects.
